# ðŸ§¬ Skin Disease Classification with Machine Learning

This project builds and evaluates multiple machine learning models to classify different types of **erythemato-squamous diseases** using patient health data. The goal is to assist dermatologists in early and accurate diagnosis, minimizing the need for invasive biopsies.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Diagnosing skin diseases is challenging due to overlapping symptoms and evolving disease stages. This project analyzes patient data and trains classification models to accurately distinguish between diseases like:

- Psoriasis
- Seborrheic dermatitis
- Lichen planus
- Pityriasis rosea
- Chronic dermatitis

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Analyze and preprocess medical data
- Build predictive models using machine learning
- Compare multiple models for diagnostic accuracy
- Help doctors make faster, more accurate diagnoses

## ðŸ§ª Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## ðŸ“Š Evaluation Metrics

- âœ… Accuracy
- ðŸ“‰ Confusion Matrix
- ðŸ§  Precision, Recall, F1-Score

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook
