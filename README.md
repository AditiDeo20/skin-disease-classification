# ðŸ§¬ Skin Disease Classification with Machine Learning

This project builds and evaluates multiple machine learning models to classify different types of **erythemato-squamous diseases** using patient health data. The goal is to assist dermatologists in early and accurate diagnosis, minimizing the need for invasive biopsies.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Diagnosing skin diseases is challenging due to overlapping symptoms and evolving disease stages. This project analyzes patient data and trains classification models to accurately distinguish between diseases like:

- Psoriasis
- Seborrheic dermatitis
- Lichen planus
- Pityriasis rosea
- Chronic dermatitis
